# C-C-Programmings

* Tic Tac Toe - Your tic tac toe with an opponent UI. I said it was 98% working on that time when I wrote it

* Walk on a Grid - I experimented with 2D grids here. It works like thos tile based movements on RPG

* Art - I experimented with creating a simple art in the console

* Map Exploration - After experimenting with walk on a grid, I created ranged drawing on console. The lights will go in and out (nope, they are not bugs).

* Battleship - Not your conventional battleship but it is a game where you need to find all the boats before your steps run out.

* CPE!A Group ni Leo Castro.cpp - I forgot to name it before uploading. This is basically a personality test survey to measure your OCEAN psychology. It runs on console.
