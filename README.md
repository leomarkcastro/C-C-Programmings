# C-C-Programmings

Tic Tac Toe - Your tic tac toe with an opponent UI. I said it was 98% working on that time when I wrote it

Walk on a Grid - I experimented with 2D grids here. It works like thos tile based movements on RPG

Art - I experimented with creating a simple art in the console

Map Exploration - After experimenting with walk on a grid, I created ranged drawing on console. The lights will go in and out (nope, they are not bugs).
